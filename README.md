##How to install A Mouseterious Adventure

###Download
Download the source code here from Github

###Setup
You need to include jQuery and LESS to run the game.
You can download jQuery here: https://jquery.com/download/
And LESS.js can be downloaded here: http://lesscss.org/#download-options

Add less.js to the head of the index.html you just downloaded:
```
&lt;link rel="stylesheet/less" type="text/css" href="css/mousesteriousAdventure.less"&gt;
&lt;script src="js/less.min.js">&lt;/script&gt;
```

Add the jquery library to your index.html, before your mouseteriousAdventure.js:
```
&lt;script src="js/jquery.js">&lt;/script&gt;<br><br>
&lt;script src="js/mouseteriousAdventure.js">&lt;/script&gt;
```

###Try it out
Open the index.html in your browser and the game should now run! If you want to integrate the game into a different html-file you can simply copy the div-element with the id mouseteriousAdventure
and all its containing elements and paste it into your new file. Just make sure you add all neccessary files (js, css etc) to your new project.
